# BikeVR
Investigating VR + Biking using google street view data and potentially ant+ bluetooth devices

## NOTICE
Yes, this breaks Google Maps TOS. This is an educational experiment for my own learning and fun. It will not be sold.
Use at your own risk and DO NOT TRY TO SELL THIS (definitely not a smart choice since it breaks their TOS).
Feel free to do whatever you like with it however, it is an open license so feel free to hack and make it better.

## References / Thanks
This project was inspired by [CycleVR](http://www.cyclevr.com/). I wanted to make an open-source version to share with the world since it is such a cool idea.

I found a lot of useful information / code at these sites:
- [Bike Tire Calculator](http://www.berkshiresports.org/index.php?ID=bikecomputertiresizecalculator) (Calculation and list of rims/tires)
- [BicycleSpeed Project](https://github.com/erndev/BicycleSpeed/) (for cadence sensor info / calculations)
- [Cadence Bluetooth Spec](https://www.bluetooth.com/specifications/gatt/viewer?attributeXmlFile=org.bluetooth.characteristic.csc_measurement.xml)
- [https server in python](http://www.piware.de/2011/01/creating-an-https-server-in-python/)

This project uses a ton of useful libraries from others including:
- [THREE.js + Examples and Libraries](https://threejs.org/)
- [GSVPano](https://github.com/spite/GSVPano.js/)
- [GSVPanoDepth](https://github.com/proog128/GSVPanoDepth.js)
- [epoly](http://www.geocodezip.com/scripts/v3_epoly.js)
- [StatsVR](https://github.com/Sean-Bradley/StatsVR/)
- [threex.renderstats](https://github.com/jeromeetienne/threex.rendererstats)
- [pako](https://github.com/nodeca/pako)
- [Pure.css](https://purecss.io/)

- icons from [feather icons](https://feathericons.com/)
- [3D Bike Model](http://impression3d.laposte.fr/en/3d-model/game/bicycle-bike)

## P.S.
So sorry if I missed anyone's work, please let me know if I did! I tried to add some stuff to comments in code as well.
None of this would have been possible without the wonderful open source community here at Github, thank you all so much!

Cheers and enjoy!
