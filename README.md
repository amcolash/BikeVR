# BikeVR
Investigating VR + Biking using google street view data and potentially ant+ bluetooth devices

This project was inspired by CycleVR (TODO LINK). I wanted to make an open-source version to share with the world since it is such a cool idea.

I found a lot of useful information at these sites:
TODO

This project uses a ton of useful stuff from others including:
- THREE.js (LINK TODO)
- GSVPano (LINK TODO)
- GSVPanoDepth (LINK TODO)
- epoly (LINK TODO)
- hidden (LINK TODO)
- stats (LINK TODO)

Note: I made a custom build of `THREE.js` (v89), I have included a patch for my custom `UVPlaneGeometry` in the root of the project. I was lazy and did not want to generate my own planes and instead added a custom version of `PlaneGeometry`.
