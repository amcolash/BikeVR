# BikeVR
Investigating VR + Biking using google street view data and potentially ant+ bluetooth devices

## [DEMO](https://bikevr-51504.firebaseapp.com)

This project was inspired by [CycleVR](http://www.cyclevr.com/). I wanted to make an open-source version to share with the world since it is such a cool idea.

I found a lot of useful information / code at these sites:
- [Bike Tire Calculator](http://www.berkshiresports.org/index.php?ID=bikecomputertiresizecalculator) (Calculation and list of rims/tires)
- [BicycleSpeed Project](https://github.com/erndev/BicycleSpeed/) (for cadence sensor info / calculations)
- [Cadence Bluetooth Spec](https://www.bluetooth.com/specifications/gatt/viewer?attributeXmlFile=org.bluetooth.characteristic.csc_measurement.xml)

This project uses a ton of useful stuff from others including:
- THREE.js (LINK TODO)
- GSVPano (LINK TODO)
- GSVPanoDepth (LINK TODO)
- epoly (LINK TODO)
- hidden (LINK TODO)
- stats (LINK TODO)
